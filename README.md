***Education:***

I am studying at Mogilev Kuleshov State University. Now I am in the 4rd year of study.

I took a course from Rolling Scopes School on front-rnd development. Where I learned how to work with js and got basic skills. Some projects from the course are presented in my repository 

I was a practicing in Modsen company, where I got to know more about react library and component approach to development. Where the development of a mini-project was carried out according to scrum methodology in which there were week-long development sprints.
