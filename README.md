***Brief information about myself:*** 

At the moment, I have set myself the goal of learning how to work with the React Framework. And make several projects on it. I studied layout independently, I thought when I entered the university I would have more opportunities to learn different information about front-end development. It turned out that they don't teach anything much.

I can't single out any of the strengths yet, because I don't work so much in this field of programming. Well, although there is experience in solving algorithmic problems, but js has its own interesting chips for solving a particular problem, which in turn require study.

There are different initial projects on the branch in the git profile for getting practice.
